Towers of Hanoi visualization in OpenGL. With automatic or manual movement.

Dependencies
------------
 * OpenGL (or Mesa)
 * GLUT (or freeglut on linux)
 * CMake

Usage
-----
To change the disk count you may edit `disks.txt`.

Interface
~~~~~~~~~
The upper left corner shows the elapsed time in seconds, the count of elapsed
movements and the movement count for the optimal solution.

Keyboard
~~~~~~~~
 - Camera movements with cursor keys
 - Reset view with space
 - zoom with '+' and '-' keys
 - toggle fullscreen with 'f'
 - reset animation with 'r'
 - change animation speed with 's' and 'x'

Manual Movement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently you can't switch to manual movement at runtime. You can change the
setting in `main.c` and recompile.

 - use the keys '1', '2' and '3' to move between the pins
 - e. g. if you wan't to take the upmost disk from pin 1 and put it on pin 3
you must press '1' '3' consecutively
