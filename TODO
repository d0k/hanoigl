Priority: high
* let the choose if he wants to play himself (not at compile time)
* display info about the controls
* fix rendering errors on high speeds
* split display() to make it maintable
* reintroduce fonts (glfw has no easy way to do this)

Priority: low
* fix little display glitches
* maybe use display lists to speed up rendering (not sure if it helps in this case)
* automatic camera movement
