Priority: high
* fix rendering errors on high speeds
* reintroduce fonts (glfw has no easy way to do this)
* reimplement manual mode (with runtime switching and control info)
* check why speed changing doesn't work

Priority: low
* fix little display glitches
* maybe use display lists to speed up rendering (not sure if it helps in this case)
* automatic camera movement
